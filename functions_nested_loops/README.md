Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

General
What are nested loops and how to use them
What is a function and how do you use functions
What is the difference between a declaration and a definition of a function
What is a prototype
Scope of variables
What are the gcc flags -Wall -Werror -pedantic -Wextra -std=gnu89
What are header files and how to to use them with #include


Requirements
General
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
All your files should end with a new line
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
You are not allowed to use global variables
No more than 5 functions per file
You are not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like printf, puts, etc… is forbidden
You are allowed to use _putchar
You don’t have to push _putchar.c, we will use our file. If you do it won’t be taken into account
In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in your header file called main.h
Don’t forget to push your header file



0. _putchar
Write a program that prints _putchar, followed by a new line.
The program should return 0


1. I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game
Write a function that prints the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line.


2. 10 x alphabet
Write a function that prints 10 times the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line.


3. islower
Write a function that checks for lowercase character.


4. isalpha
Write a function that checks for alphabetic character.


5. Sign
Write a function that prints the sign of a number.


6. There is no such thing as absolute value in this world. You can only estimate what a thing is worth to you
Write a function that computes the absolute value of an integer.


7. There are only 3 colors, 10 digits, and 7 notes; it's what we do with them that's important
Write a function that prints the last digit of a number.


8. I'm federal agent Jack Bauer, and today is the longest day of my life
Write a function that prints every minute of the day of Jack Bauer, starting from 00:00 to 23:59.


9. Learn your times table
Write a function that prints the 9 times table, starting with 0.


10. a + b
Write a function that adds two integers and returns the result.


11. 98 Battery Street, the OG
